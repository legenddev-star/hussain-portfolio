      "At Open edX, I led the modernization of the e-learning platform, improving performance, scalability, and user experience. I rebuilt the course player using React and Next.js, optimized performance with ISR and SSR, and refactored backend services with FastAPI and Node.js. I also developed a drag-and-drop course editor, integrated real-time analytics with Kafka, and optimized video streaming via AWS CloudFront and HLS. Additionally, I automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Docker and enhanced system observability with Datadog and Prometheus, all while mentoring developers and driving best practices in an agile environment.",

      "At SpectralNet, I built scalable web applications for biomedical research, helping scientists analyze complex datasets efficiently. I designed a modular React-based front end, developed FastAPI/Flask backend services, and integrated Neo4j to model biological relationships for drug discovery. I also optimized query performance for vast datasets, integrated machine learning models, and built interactive data visualization dashboards. To ensure scalability, I deployed cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure) and automated CI/CD pipelines. Throughout, I worked closely with researchers, led technical discussions, and ensured compliance with HIPAA and GDPR for secure biomedical data handling.Development of responsive websites (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, WordPress). Customizations and SEO optimization. Close collaboration with clients to implement tailored solutions.",
